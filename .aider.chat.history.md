I have an idea where we are free to customize your motorcycle, that includes drag, place, rotate, resize decals directly onto realistic 3d model of their chosen bike
Based on the concept "Ride Your Style: A 3D Web Platform for Custom Motorcycle Modifications and Visual Design," develop a structured research outline that covers:

Introduction to motorcycle culture and the growing demand for customization
Current limitations of traditional design methods (manual processes, lack of visual preview)
Benefits of implementing a 3D interactive platform with drag-and-drop functionality
Core features including motorcycle selection, paint tools, decal/sticker systems, and accessory placement

User experience workflow from selection to final design export
Market potential targeting enthusiasts, custom shops, and online retailers
Future expansion possibilities (mobile AR, multi-vehicle support, shop integration)

#### Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.  

The changes you’ll need to make are in the following files:

1. `mini-app/lib/metadata.ts` – update the `title` and `description` values.  
2. `mini-app/public/logo.png.todo` – create or update the logo generation instructions.  

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the exact *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

A stylized motorcycle silhouette in motion, with a paintbrush and decal icons overlayed on its side, set against a gradient background that transitions from deep blue to bright orange, conveying creativity and customization. The motorcycle is rendered in a sleek, modern style with subtle shading to give depth, while the paintbrush and decal icons are simple, bold shapes that suggest artistic tools. The overall composition is balanced and dynamic, suitable for a logo that represents a 3D customization platform.
